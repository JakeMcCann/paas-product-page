        <h2 class="content-section__title">Benefits of GOV.UK PaaS</h2>
        <p class="content-section__body">Using GOV.UK PaaS means teams can deploy and run applications without having to build and manage their own infrastructure. This avoids unnecessary repetition across government, with infrastructure and webops engineers spending less time solving the same problems.</p>
        <p class="content-section__body">Service teams can:</p>
        <ul class="list list-bullet">
          <li>save time and money on setting up a hosting infrastructure</li>
          <li>deploy and run applications written in a range of languages and frameworks</li>
          <li>rapidly scale applications</li>
          <li>easily manage applications</li>
          <li>get 24 hour platform-level support</li>
          <li>get started easily with a simple procurement process</li>

        <h2 class="content-section__title">What it is</h2>
        <p class="content-section__body">GOV.UK PaaS is hosted by Amazon Web Services (AWS) and runs from AWS’s European data centre in Ireland. The PaaS is:</p>
          <ul class="list list-bullet">
            <li>resilient since it operates across three independent availability zones</li>
            <li>able to support a PostgreSQL database service (powered by AWS)</li>
            <li>accredited for handling information classified as Official</li>
            <li>built on an open source platform (Cloud Foundry) and deployed to a public cloud</li>
            <li>flexible since applications aren’t locked into one cloud provider</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="content-section__body">The PaaS is already being used by the GOV.UK Trade Tariff live service, as well as several services building prototypes.</p>
        <p class="content-section__body"><a href="/features.html">Find out more about GOV.UK PaaS</a>. This includes how it’s built, run and supported, as well as how to use it.</p>

      <section class="content-section content-section--with-top-border">
        <h2 class="content-section__title">What you pay for</h2>
        <p class="content-section__body">You pay for what you use, like hosting, compute resource and backing services such as a database. The Government Digital Service will pay for building and maintaining the platform.</p>

        <h2 class="content-section__title">Criteria for deploying an application to the PaaS</h2>
        <p class="content-section__body">Your application can run on the PaaS if it:</p>
        <ul class="list list-bullet">
            <li>follows the twelve-factor application principles – this will be the case if your application was written to be deployed to another PaaS, such as Heroku</li>
            <li>doesn’t require any backing service apart from a PostgreSQL database</li>
            <li>doesn’t carry data certified as Secret or above</li>
            <li>is written in a language supported by the <a href="https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/buildpacks/">default Cloud Foundry buildpacks</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="content-section__body">The overall cost depends on factors such as the number of environments you deploy to, the size and number of your applications and whether they need to have high availability.</p>
