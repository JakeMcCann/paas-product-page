      <h1 class="heading-xlarge">Roadmap for GOV.UK PaaS</h1>
      <p>We want to build GOV.UK PaaS to be useful for service teams across government. This roadmap is a rough indication of what we’re planning to build in the near, medium and long-term based on what users have told us they need.</p>

      <p>If you would like to find out more about these plans, or you have feedback on whether or not these features are useful for you, please <a href="/support.html">get in touch</a>.</p>

      <p>To see the features and benefits the PaaS offers right now, see <a href="/">our product page</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="heading-large">Roadmap</h2>
      <p>This roadmap is for informational purposes only and may be affected by changing priorities. You shouldn’t rely on this information for major purchasing or planning purposes.</p>
      
      <h3 class="heading-medium">Near-term</h3>

      <ul class="list list-bullet">
		  <li>Redis as a backing service</li>
		  <li>Self-service SSL certificate management</li>
	</ul>

	  <h3 class="heading-medium">Medium-term</h3>

      <ul class="list list-bullet">
		  <li>Elasticsearch as a backing service</li>
		  <li>MongoDB as a backing service</li>
		  <li>Self-service user management</li>
		  <li>Enhanced backing service monitoring</li>
	</ul>

		 <h3 class="heading-medium">Long-term</h3>

      <ul class="list list-bullet">
		  <li>Private networking for applications</li>
		  <li>User application monitoring</li>
	</ul>

	 <h2 class="heading-large">Requested features</h2>

	 <p>Below are the features we’ve been asked about but are not planning to develop right now, and why.</p>

	 <h3 class="heading-medium">Docker</h3>

	 <p>Cloud Foundry supports pushing a Docker image as an application. This feature is not currently enabled on GOV.UK PaaS because allowing deployment from Docker images, where the root filesystem is controlled by the tenant, raises additional security concerns: <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/diego-design-notes/blob/c59e475020a22e244c6074f89c45b55f7b1e2867/docker-support.md#docker-in-a-multi-tenant-world">see this note from the Cloud Foundry developers</a> for more details.</p>

	 <p>We hope to enable support for Docker images in the future. If you would like to be able to push Docker images, please <a href="/support.html">contact our support team</a>, and let us know why.</p>

	 <h3 class="heading-medium">Cloud Foundry route services</h3>
		
    
      <p>Cloud Foundry has a feature called <a href="https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/services/route-services.html">route services</a>. This allows you to filter and transform requests before they reach application instances.</p>
      <p>At present we don't know of any use cases for this feature amongst our users. If you would like to use it, <a href="/support.html">contact our support team</a>, providing details of what you would like to use it for.</p>
