			You can view the availability and database connectivity of live applications on GOV.UK PaaS on <a href="https://status.cloud.service.gov.uk/">our system status page</a>. If you have a critical issue, start by checking this page: if it’s an issue with GOV.UK PaaS we’re already working on it, and we’ll keep our users updated on the progression of the incident.
			</p>

			<h2 class="heading-large">Report an issue</h2>
			<p>
			You can email us at <a href="mailto:gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk">gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk</a>.

			We will start working on critical issues impacting production services within 20 or 40 minutes, depending on the time of the day. Read more about <a href="/support-and-response-times#response_times">how we classify issues and our response times</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
If you have a critical issue outside of working hours and you want to get in touch with us, use the emergency email address you have been given. It will raise a high priority ticket that could alert us during the night, so it should only be used for critical incidents. Please do not share this email address with people outside of your team.
