			<h2 class="heading-medium">Start with a 3-month trial period</h2>
			<p>
				When a team starts using GOV.UK PaaS, they get to try out the platform
				for 3 months.
			</p>
			<p>
				During this period they can test the majority of the features,
				including:
			</p>
			<ul class="list list-bullet">
				<li>
					managing user accounts
				</li>
				<li>
					creating and managing environments
				</li>
				<li>
					deploying and running apps
				</li>
				<li>
					using trial-sized editions of our backing services
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The trial period is free of charge, but users are only allowed a capped
				quota of resources, can’t set up custom domains and can’t run
				production apps on the platform.
			</p>
			<p>
				<a href="/signup">
					Start your trial period
				</a>
			</p>

			<h2 class="heading-medium">Using the full-featured platform</h2>
			<p>
				You have up to 3 months to decide whether GOV.UK PaaS is for you. At
				the end of the trial period, if you want to keep using the platform
				we’ll ask you to sign a memorandum of understanding - you’ll get access
				to the full set of features and we’ll start billing you. 
			</p>
			<p>
				You will be charged monthly, based on the resources you use. Use our
				calculator to
				<a href="https://admin.cloud.service.gov.uk/calculator">
					get an estimate of how much it would cost you to use GOV.UK PaaS</a>.
				You don’t have to commit to a long-term contract and you can enable and
				disable apps, databases and services as required.
			</p>
			<p>
				If at the end of the trial period you decide that GOV.UK PaaS is not
				the right solution for you, we will close your
				<a href="https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/#organisations">organisation</a>
				and all the user accounts associated to it.
			</p>

			<h2 class="heading-medium">How is GOV.UK PaaS priced</h2>
			<p>
				Our pricing model is designed to recover the costs of the raw resources
				used on GOV.UK PaaS and the time our team spends on making these
				available to you via GOV.UK PaaS.
			</p>
			<p>
				When we bill you we will recharge the resources you effectively use. We
				then apply a platform fee to some of these costs where we provision
				infrastructure to ensure high-availability, fast application deployment
				and scalability for the hosted service. The bill will list these costs
				and show you where the fee has been applied.
			</p>
			<p>
				The bill also includes a service fee to cover the internal overhead of
				procuring, managing and making sure the platform complies with
				information assurance standards.
