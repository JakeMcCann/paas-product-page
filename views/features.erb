			<h2 class="heading-medium">The basics</h2>
			<ul class="list list-bullet">
				<li>GOV.UK PaaS runs from Amazon Web Services in Ireland. UK-based hosting is being planned for 2018</li>
				<li>It’s resilient since it operates across three independent availability zones</li>
				<li>It’s built on an open source PaaS platform (Cloud Foundry)</li>
				<li>You can decide to move to other Cloud Foundry-based PaaS providers, including on GCloud, as you’re not locked into our platform</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 class="heading-medium">Security</h2>
			<ul class="list list-bullet">
				<li>It’s accredited for handling personal and confidential information classified as Official</li>
				<li>It allows SSH access to containers</li>
				<li>Applications running on the platform are isolated from each other so they can’t read or change each other's code, data or logs</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="content-section__body">
				<a href="/security">Read more about how we keep GOV.UK PaaS secure</a>

			<ul class="list list-bullet">
				<li>It takes a few minutes to create sandbox and testing environments, and even less to delete them once you don’t need them anymore</li>
				<li>Set up a new DB or service in minutes with the CloudFoundry command line or an API: no tickets or requests required</li>
				<li>Service teams can grow their service from prototype to production without replatforming</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 class="heading-medium">Deploying and running apps</h2>
			<ul class="list list-bullet">
				<li>Manage applications with the CloudFoundry command line or API</li>
				<li>Scale applications up and downs in seconds</li>
				<li>You can build on the API or the command line to enable auto-scaling</li>
				<li>Deploy from CI services such as Travis or Jenkins</li>
				<li>Use a custom domain to host your app</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 class="heading-medium">Performance</h2>
			<ul class="list list-bullet">
				<li>You can check the status of the platform on our <a href="https://status.cloud.service.gov.uk/">system status page</a></li>
				<li>Application logs can be streamed to SaaS logging platforms if service teams need to monitor app-specific performance metrics</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 class="heading-medium">Support and maintenance</h2>
			<p>The GOV.UK PaaS team provides platform-level support 24/7. If your team is experiencing any issue using the platform we can provide assistance during office hours.</p>
			<p>The GOV.UK PaaS team is in charge of monitoring the infrastructure, and patching operating systems and infrastructure components. We use zero downtime deploys, so upgrades to the PaaS won't interfere with the running of your application.</p>
